# JavaTheHutt
This is a working project on the development of a functioning backgammon game.
The game is currently being worked on by Adam Waldron, Niall McGurk and Magnus Sanne.
To run this code: The "Initialize" java file contains the main and the program can be run from there.
There are several different UI points that the user can interact with to use the program.
These features are clearly laid out on the UI, command box, enter button etc.
This code is a work in progress.

At the end of a game, if the points total has not been reached the user is required to enter anything into the command box and then press enter to start the next game.
Entering "cheat2" or "cheat3" will demonstrate how the user can achieve more than 1 or two points per game depending on their oponents checkers positions.
